Scripts used for 16S processing and R data analysis

Scripts for sequence processing and R analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcripts from : 1) dehumidifier fluid (as a potential contaminant) (2 L), 2) DUSEL 3A fluid (2 L), 3) electrode-attached biofilms in ISEC (3 x 4 cm), 4) electrode-attached biofilms of the laboratory electrochemical enrichments (1 x 0.5 cm), and 5) abiotic control.
